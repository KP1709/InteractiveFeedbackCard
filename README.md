# InteractiveFeedbackCard

## üçº Introduction
This is a project I discovered on Frontend Mentor titled interactive Feedback Card. 
The user is asked to enter a score and submit it. The score should be recorded and presented on a different screen saying 'thank you'.  
Although this projects comes from the site, it does not directly follow the design specification given (e.g. using the same SVG images).  
I wanted to do this project to test out my HTML, CSS and JS skills to see how far I have developed them. This will help me reflect on what to do next.  

## üìö Resources used  
- DivSwapJS- https://codepen.io/timmehnz/pen/MKVVLJ?editors=1010  
- How to keep an Active CSS Style After Clicked On Button - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh1xus05Kl8  

## ‚ûï Additional features added
- The next screen will show if the user has selected a score and pressed submit.
  - If there is no score entered, then the screen won't change.
  - This is to prevent showing a gap of where the score would be displayed in the sentence.
- Once a score has been selected, the user cannot unactivate the value unless if they select a different value.  
  - It prevents having no score submitted.
